# TODO List for Adding Animations and Populating Class Members

- [x] Populate index.html with 35 member profile cards in the members-grid section, using placeholders for missing data and adding role badges for structure members.
- [x] Add CSS animations (fadeInUp keyframe and classes) to styles.css for slide-up effects.
- [x] Add JavaScript logic to script.js using Intersection Observer to trigger animations on scroll.
- [x] Test the page by opening index.html in browser to verify animations and layout.
